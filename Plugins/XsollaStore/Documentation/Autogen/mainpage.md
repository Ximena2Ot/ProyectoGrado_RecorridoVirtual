# SDK composition

The SDK consists of the following parts:

*   The main SDK module — a set of classes that are data structures and methods for making requests to the Xsolla REST APIs. The main SDK module includes:
    *   Methods and classes for working with user authentication, obtaining user information, etc.
    *   Methods and data structures for working with virtual items and virtual currencies, making purchases, payment processing, managing a shopping cart, opening the payment UI, etc.
    *   Methods and classes for managing the player's inventory and the virtual currency balance.
*   Demo project module — a set of blueprints and assets to demonstrate how the SDK works.


## The main SDK module


### SDK methods for calling the Xsolla APIs

To send requests to Xsolla servers and receive responses, the SDK provides the UXsollaStoreSubsystem, UXsollaLoginSubsystem and UXsollaInventorySubsystem classes. If you want to implement your own logic for buying items or inventory management, and don’t want to write boilerplate code for API calls, these classes are a good place to start.

The UXsollaLoginSubsystem class includes methods to implement the following features:
*   sign-up
*   email confirmation
*   user authentication via various mechanisms
*   password reset
*   cross-platform account linking
*   managing user attributes
*   user account

The UXsollaStoreSubsystem class includes methods to implement the following features:
*   selling virtual items, virtual currency, and subscriptions
*   managing an in-game store
*   managing a shopping cart
*   working with promotional campaigns (discounts, coupons, and promo codes)

The UXsollaInventorySubsystem class includes methods to implement the following features:
*   managing user inventory
*   managing cross-platform inventory
*   managing virtual currency balance

The UXsollaStoreSubsystem and UXsollaLoginSubsystem are wrapper classes for the standard [IHttpRequest](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Runtime/HTTP/Interfaces/IHttpRequest/index.html) class. Since the methods for API calls initiate asynchronous requests to the Xsolla servers, they use [delegates](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/UnrealArchitecture/Delegates/index.html) as parameters. Delegates are called when a response is received from the server.

### Data and classes for working with API

In addition to methods for calling the API, the SDK contains data and classes for making requests to the API and receiving a response.

**Example:**

*   The FStoreCartItem class describes a cart object (name, type, and other attributes).
*   The FXsollaSocialFriendsData is data describing a user's list of friends.


## Demo project module

### General information

The demo project represents one of the possible logics for the login system, inventory, and in-game store based on Xsolla products. The demo uses the preset project in Publisher Account with a fully configured in-game store.

You can use the demo project in two ways:

* As an example.
* As an initial version of the login system, inventory, and in-game store. You can get an instant result and expand the demo features if needed.

To try the demo, launch the demo map from the `Content Browser > Xsolla Content > Maps` directory.

See the [SDK documentation](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unreal-engine/demo/general-info/) to learn more.

### Blueprints

Most of the code in the demo project is the ordinary widget blueprints that use the SDK:

*   Page controllers.

  **Example:**

  The `W_LoginDemo` manages the user's login page. It determines whether the user is authorized, and if not, it can display a sign-up page or a new user registration page.

*   Blueprints for UI building and managing.

  **Example:**

  The `W_CartPanel` builds a page with information about the cart data (e.g., the number of items to purchase) and counts and shows the total purchase price, etc.

*   Pop-up windows displaying various information to the user (e.g., successful purchase information or a field for entering a coupon).
